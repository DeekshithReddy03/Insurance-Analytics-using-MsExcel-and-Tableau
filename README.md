# Insurance Analytics (Interactive dashboards built using MS Excel, Tableau, Power BI)
## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze insurance sales data to gain insights into cross-sell performance, policy renewals, new business acquisition, and account executive efficiency. The goal is to enable data-driven decision-making by visualizing key metrics such as revenue, meeting counts, invoices, and opportunity stages using Tableau, Power BI, and Excel. This multi-tool approach demonstrates how the same dataset can be effectively used across different BI platforms for comprehensive business analysis and performance tracking.

## Question (KPI’s)
-	No of Invoice by Account Executive: Displays the total number of invoices generated by each Account Executive, highlighting individual performance in driving revenue.
-	Yearly Meeting Count: Shows the number of client meetings held in 2019 and 2020, helping assess engagement efforts over time.
-	Cross Sell – Target, Achieved, New: Compares the cross-sell revenue target with the actual achieved and newly generated invoice amounts, measuring success in selling additional products.
-	New – Target, Achieved, New: Visualizes how much new business revenue was targeted, actually achieved, and invoiced, indicating business growth performance.
-	Renewal – Target, Achieved, New: Tracks policy renewal performance by comparing target revenue with achieved and newly invoiced renewal
-	Stage Funnel by Revenue: Breaks down the total revenue across opportunity stages (e.g., Qualify, Propose, Negotiate), helping identify where revenue is concentrated or lost in the sales pipeline.
-	No of Meetings by Account Executive: Illustrates how many meetings each executive conducted, reflecting their client interaction frequency and effort.
-	Top Open Opportunity: Highlights the top 4 revenue-generating open opportunities, allowing focus on high-value prospects for conversion.
## Process
-	Collected and cleaned the insurance dataset in Excel to ensure accuracy and consistency.
-	Identified key KPIs such as invoices, meetings, cross-sell, renewals, new business, and opportunity stages.
-	Used the same dataset to build dashboards individually in Tableau, Power BI, and Excel.
-	Applied charts, filters, and visuals to represent each KPI clearly and interactively.
-	Focused on comparing performance by Account Executives and tracking targets vs achievements.
-	Finalized dashboards to showcase how different BI tools can be used to derive similar insights.
## Project Insights
-	Account Executive Performance: Certain Account Executives consistently lead in both the number of invoices and meetings held. This indicates a strong correlation between client interaction and revenue generation. These top performers can serve as benchmarks for others.
-	Cross-Sell Effectiveness: Cross-sell revenue achievement varies significantly across Account Executives. While some are close to meeting targets, others lag, suggesting inconsistent product bundling or follow-up strategies. There's an opportunity to train underperformers on upselling techniques.
-	Renewal Trends: Renewal targets are often not fully met, and the number of new invoices from renewals is relatively low. This could point to customer churn or poor follow-up on expiring policies, indicating a need to strengthen retention strategies.
-	New Business Acquisition: New business is a strong contributor to total revenue, with several Account Executives exceeding targets. This reflects effective prospecting strategies. Tracking which channels or approaches lead to success could further improve acquisition rates.
-	Year-over-Year Engagement: Meeting counts increased notably from 2019 to 2020. This suggests enhanced client engagement efforts, potentially driven by digital outreach or improved CRM processes. Maintaining or increasing this momentum is crucial for pipeline health.
-	Sales Funnel Blockages: The stage funnel reveals that a large portion of revenue remains in early or mid-stages like "Qualify" and "Propose." This implies delays or inefficiencies in advancing deals through the pipeline. Sales cycle optimization may be needed.
-	Meetings by Executive: There's noticeable variation in how frequently Account Executives conduct meetings. Since higher meeting frequency correlates with more invoices, this metric can be used to coach and monitor low-performing team members.
-	Top Open Opportunities: The dashboard highlights a few high-revenue, open opportunities that remain unclosed. Focusing on closing these deals could have a significant positive impact on short-term revenue goals.
## Final Conclusion 
This Insurance Analytics dashboard effectively consolidates key performance metrics across multiple BI tools like Tableau, Power BI, and Excel demonstrating how consistent insights can be derived from the same dataset. By visualizing invoice counts, meeting activity, revenue targets, and opportunity stages, the dashboards provide actionable intelligence to improve sales performance, customer retention, and pipeline management. The comparative analysis highlights areas of strength and opportunities for growth, empowering stakeholders to make informed, data-driven decisions that drive business success.
